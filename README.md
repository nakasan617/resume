## 1. merkle tree implementation in C
### BRIEF EXPLANATION
This is hash tree implemented in C. 
The technique is used in many places including block chain and version control. The technique allows the fast and efficient verification of the data by using hash, and tree data structure. 

### THE PURPOSE OF THE POST
I posted this mainly to show my understanding of pointers, but there are somewhat algorithmically interesting parts using recursive functions. 

## 2. undefeatable tic-tac-toe
### BRIEF EXPLANATION
This program allows you to play tic-tac-toe against the computer, who is supposedly undefeatable. 
It uses min-max algorithm and plays the optimal strategy. Explanation to how to play is written in the directory tic-tac-toe. 

### THE PURPOSE OF THE POST
I posted this simply because I thought this was a cool program, and it shows my interest in game theory and economics, which I studied for the undergrad. 

### SHORTCOMINGS
If in the situation where if you play optimally, the computer giveup, i.e. it plays the left most slot available. 
The game is, obviously, computationally intensive, because strategy set grows exponentially and as of now serial implementation is done. 

## 3. Neural Network implementation from scratch in python
### BRIEF EXPLANATION 
This is the python implementation over the data of MNIST.  
I made this to gain more understanding over the algorithm. 

### THE PURPOSE OF THE POST
To show my mathematical understanding of the machine learning algorithms, and my ability to use python libraries, mainly numpy and pandas
