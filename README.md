## 1. merkle tree implementation in C
This is hash tree implemented in C. 
I posted this mainly to show my understanding of pointers, but there are some interesting part using recursive functions. 
The technique is used in many places including block chain and version control. The technique allows the fast and efficient verification of the data by using hash, and tree data structure. 

## 2. undefeatable tic-tac-toe
I posted this simply because I thought this was a cool program, and it shows my interest in game theory and economics, which I studied for the undergrad. 
This program allows you to play tic-tac-toe against the computer, who is supposedly undefeatable. 
It uses min-max algorithm and plays the optimal strategy. 
However, if in the situation where if you play optimally, the computer giveup, i.e. it plays the left most slot available. 
The game is, obviously, computationally intensive, because strategy set grows exponentially and as of now serial implementation is done. Explanation to how to play is written in the directory tic-tac-toe. 

## 3. Neural Network implementation from scratch in python
I made this to gain more understanding over the algorithm. The purpose I post them here is to show my mathematical understanding of the machine learning algorithms, and my ability to use python libraries, mainly numpy and pandas. 
The hardest part was indexing and it took me almost 8 hours to get it right.
