## HOW TO PLAY 
type make in the current directory. This will make an executable, ./game. 
run the ./game. 
follow the instructions given on the console. 

### OPTIONS IN THE GAME
You can choose the board size, since it takes so much time if the board size is too big, I recommend typing in 4.  
You can choose how many coins are necessary to win the game, to see the algorithm working, 3 would suffice. 
you can choose the player to be either human, random, or computer. When you choose human, you need to choose the slot to play, whereas for random, the slot is randomly chosen, and for computer, optimal strategy used min-max algorithm is played.
